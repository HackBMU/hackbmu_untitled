## Gesture Bot

Most speech-impaired people in rural areas are unaware of standard sign languages.
This may be due to lack of familiarity with English.
Therefore, the individual most likely communicates using his/her own signs.
Our solution learns from the individual’s gestures and aids in interacting with a computer.
We present a gesture-based input technique that allows user to interact with a chatbot.
This chatbot replies in the user’s native language, via text or TTS.
